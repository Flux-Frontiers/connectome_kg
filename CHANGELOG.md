# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`connectome-kg files`**, and the portal labels in the manifest. The Codex
  download page lists display names, not file names: `neurons.csv.gz` appears
  as "Neurotransmitter Type Predictions" and `connections_princeton.csv.gz` as
  "Connections (Filtered)", which makes a download impossible to match against
  a manifest by eye. Every manifest entry now carries the portal's own label
  and size, `verify` prints the mapping when a required file is missing, and
  `FAFB_783_UNUSED` records the assets the build deliberately skips with the
  reason for each.

### Changed

- **Checksum differences are reported as drift, not failure.** Codex states
  that its downloads are synchronised with the live database and may differ
  from the October 2024 published snapshot, so a digest that does not match
  the August 2026 download this manifest fingerprints is expected rather than
  corrupt. `ManifestReport.ok` now depends only on the required files being
  present, drift is listed separately with the counts to check instead, and
  `STATIC_ARCHIVES` records the no-login Zenodo and GitHub snapshots to use
  when a build has to be reproducible.

- **The Codex reader no longer hard-codes the connections file name.** Codex
  has shipped that table as both `connections_princeton.csv.gz` and
  `connections.csv.gz`, so a hard-coded name made a perfectly good download
  unreadable. `find_connections_file()` picks whichever variant is present,
  preferring the thresholded Princeton table, `--connections-file` overrides
  it, and the reader resolves column aliases (`pre_root_id` / `pre_pt_root_id`
  / `pre`, `syn_count` / `weight`, and so on) reporting exactly which column
  it could not find. `verify` accepts any connections variant and names the
  one it found.

### Fixed

- **The synthetic fixture crashed below 361 neurons.** The planted circuits
  claim a fixed number of neurons from each super class, so a small
  `n_neurons` ran the visual projection population out and pandas raised an
  opaque length error. `synthetic_tables()` now refuses a too-small size and
  names the minimum, which `min_neurons()` derives from the plant table
  rather than hard-coding.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Initial import from the `kgrag_priv/connectome_kg` prototype: normalised
  connectome tables, the FlyWire FAFB v783 release manifest with checksums,
  the Codex reader, a seeded synthetic connectome with planted feeding,
  escape and grooming circuits, the extractor emitting neurons, cell types,
  neuropils, hemilineages, labels and taxa with signed synapse edges,
  `ConnectomeKG(KGModule)` with strongest-path and cone queries and a
  Markdown analysis, and the `connectome-kg` CLI.
